## Project : Portal For The Course

### Collaborators : 210050033 , 210050134 , 210050162

We have developed a website using Django, Python and HTML which functions as a Learning Management System.
Key features of it include:
1. User Login, Logout and Signup, Update profile
2. Course Management
3. Creating and deleting assignments
4. Making Submissions and Grading Submissions
5. Seperate User-Interface for teachers and students

Explanation of the feature is as follows:

#### User Login, Logout, Updating Profile and registration:
When we start the server using the local host, the first page one encounters is the login page. Here one can login in using the credentials or signup.
One will never be able to bypass loginpage by directly entering the url. If tried so, they will be redirected to a page saying "oops!wrong location"

![registrationpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111419098/204011407-33a835dc-3407-4487-bd24-bd0fa64567f8.jpg)

The role of the user is differentiated while doing signup where the user would be able to choose whether he/she is enrolling as a teacher or a student. While login, the user enters only the username and password. The backend part searches for the user, checks if the user is a teacher or not and redirects the user to their respected homepage.\
The user will be able to update their profile i.e, they will be able to change the password once they finished login to the homepage.

While updating the profile, It is strongly advised **not to change** the role of the user

One can logout of the website by clicking the logout button in the homepages once they login and then it will be redirected again to the loginpage



#### HomePages:

Once the user is able to login, the teachers and students are redirected to their repected hompages

##### Teacher HomePage

Teacher Homepage includes the fields:
1. Update profile
2. Logout
3. Create Course
4. Existing Courses

A teacher can create a course, delete a course and view the existing courses by clicking on them.
While creating a course, the teacher should add atleast one student to the course and keeping that in mind, entering the remaining fields will successfully create a course and the teacher would be redirected to the teacherhomepage.
On clicking the Existing coursepage, the teacher will be redirected to the Coursepage for the teacher.

##### Student HomePage

Student Homepage includes features like:
1. Update profile
2. Logout
3. Register for a course
4. View a coursepage

A student will not be able to create a course and will only be able to register for a course. 
A student on clicking the link for registering for a course will then be redirected to a page where he/she is required to enter the course code to join the course. Once the course code is entered, then the student will be enrolled in that course and will then be redirected to the student homepage.
On clicking the Courses in which he is already enrolled, he will be redirected to the coursepage for student.
